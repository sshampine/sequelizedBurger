# Sequelized Burger

or **Eat da Burger! The Sequel**

This week's challenge was to create a restaurant app that lets users enter burgers they'd like to eat. Eat da Burger is a full stack app that uses the MVS model. The front end is bootstrap using a handlebars template, while the backend is node.js and mySQL. A modles file contains ORM functions used to interface with the ORM file. The ORM module handles the SQL queries. 

## How to use

1. [Link to Site]()
1. Enter a burger you'd like to eat. 
1. Each burger has a Devour button in the Eat da Burger waiting area. Clicking the button will move the burger to Burgers in my Belly.
1. Clicking Poop out da Burger will remove the burger from the list.
1. Every burger is stored in the database whether devoured or not. BUT once the burger is pooped out, it's removed from the database.
