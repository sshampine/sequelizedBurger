# Sequelized Burger

or **Eat da Burger! The Sequel**

This week's challenge was to create sequelized version of [Burger](https://github.com/sshampine/burger) - a restaurant app that lets users enter burgers they'd like to eat. Sequelized Burger is a full stack app that uses the MVS model. The front end is bootstrap using a handlebars template, while the backend is node.js and mySQL. Sequelize is used to handles the SQL queries. 

## How to use

1. [Link to Site](https://frozen-scrubland-77093.herokuapp.com/)
1. Enter a burger you'd like to eat. 
1. Each burger has a Devour button in the Eat da Burger waiting area. Clicking the Devour button will move the burger to Burgers in my Belly.
1. Clicking Poop out da Burger will remove the burger from the list - deleting it from the database.
1. Every burger is stored in the database whether devoured or not. BUT once the burger is pooped out, it's removed from the database.
